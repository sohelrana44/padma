    The Padma River is known for heavy bank erosion, shifting channels, and sandbars that continually emerge in its course. Its main tributary is the Mahananda; its principal distributary is the Madhumati (called the Garai in its upper course). The flow of the Padma is controlled seasonally by the Farakka Barrage, located a few miles upstream in West Bengal, India. A number of major urban centres, including Rajshahi and Pabna, are located along the Padma. The river forms a busy waterway and is a rich source of fish.

    river, Bangladesh
    By The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Edit History

    Meghna River, major watercourse of the Padma River (Ganges [Ganga] River) delta, in Bangladesh. The name is properly applied to a channel of the Old Brahmaputra downstream from Bhairab Bazar, after it has received the Surma (Barak) River. Flowing almost due south, the Meghna receives the combined waters of the Padma and Jamuna (the name of the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh) rivers near Chandpur. After a course of about 164 miles (264 km) it enters the Bay of Bengal by four principal mouths—Tetulia, Shahbazpur, Hatia, and Bamni. Major tributaries are the Dhaleswari, the Gumti (the name of the Gomati in Bangladesh), and the Feni. A river of great depth and velocity, the Meghna is sometimes split up into several channels and sandbanks of its own formation. It is navigable, but dangerous, all year. At spring tide the sea rushes upriver in a bore that may reach nearly 20 feet (6 metres).

      <p> Ganges delta, orGanges-Brahmaputra<b>delta, Region in West Bengal state,<b>.India, and Bangladesh An area of about 220 mi (355 km) <b>
      wide along the Bay of Bengal, it is covered by the network of streams <b>forming the mouths of the Ganges (Ganga) and Brahmaputra rivers. In Bangladesh
          the Brahmaputra is joined by the Tista River and, from there to its junction with the Ganges, is known as the
          Jamuna River. The main streams, the Ganges and the Jamuna, unite to form the Padma River.
          The river farthest west that enters the Bay of Bengal is the Hugli River. Many smaller streams of the
          delta form a swamp region for about 160 miles (260 km) along the coast, known as the Sundarbans.<b>
          The delta was struck in 1970 by one of history’s most devastating cyclones.</b></b></b></b></b></p><b><b><b>
